ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @WealthWolves
I'm interested in extracting product information and optimizing the process of listing products on Amazon.
I'm currently learning techniques to efficiently gather data like product name, description, price, UPC, and brand from various websites.
I'm looking to collaborate with like-minded individuals who share a passion for streamlining the product listing experience on Amazon.
You can reach me at breakthruimagine@gmail.com to discuss collaboration opportunities and any questions you may have.
